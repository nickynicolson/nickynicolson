Nicky Nicolson

👋 Hello - I'm Nicky, a software developer turned biodiversity informatics researcher: I try to use collaborative practices (version control, dependency management, continuous integration etc) to build tools, analyse & mobilise natural history specimen data. 

I grew up on a farm, where I learned about 🌻🌳🍄🦉🦇 🕸🦔🐍🐄 ... & building/ fixing things with whatever is available 🛠 Firstgen student of botany then computer science, still learning with [OpenLifeSciences](https://openlifesci.org/) 

I've worked at [Kew Gardens](https://www.kew.org/science) in London since 1998 - firstly in a series of software development roles, helping researchers and curators manage and mobilise scientific information (effectively a [Research Software Engineer](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/research-software-engineers) role), before switching into the research stream where I did a [doctorate](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/19620) using our digitised specimen data to detect previously unmanaged data entities (collectors, expeditions etc). This research was applied in the data portal for the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://gbif.org) where it helps researchers navigate between [related records](https://www.gbif.org/news/4U1dz8LygQvqIywiRIRpAU/new-data-clustering-feature-aims-to-improve-data-quality-and-reveal-cross-dataset-connections). I'm interested in how we use software development practices (revision control, dependency management, build automation, reuse, continuous integration) in managing the research process.

Some current projects include:
- [echinopscis - an extensible notebook for open science on specimens](https://echinopscis.github.io)
- Tropical Plant ID Handbook - Myrtales
- Using large language models to atomise descriptive paragraphs into traits and states - part of the identification task force for the [World Flora Online](https://www.worldfloraonline.org/)
- Assessing automated transcription tools ([Voucher Vision](https://github.com/Gene-Weaver/VoucherVision/), hespi etc)
